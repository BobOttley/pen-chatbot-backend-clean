  "With class sizes no larger than sixteen, our Form Tutors’ knowledge of the girls is second to none. Our proactive approach to tackling any issues that may arise creates a safe and warm environment in which pupils flourish.",
  "Personal, Social, Health & Economic (PSHE)",
  "PSHE is delivered primarily in Form Time every Wednesday and is supplemented by a number of specialist assemblies, themed weeks and guest speakers throughout the year.  Topics covered include:",
  "Online Safety",
  "Drugs and Alcohol Education",
  "Emotional Resilience",
  "Relationships and Sex Education",
  "Our PSHE provision is regularly reviewed to ensure it meets the needs of our pupils in an ever-changing world.",
  "We are also pleased to offer termly talks for parents on a range of topics.",
  "The Senior Teacher Pastoral and PSHE and the Deputy Head Pastoral",
  "The Senior Teacher Pastoral and PSHE works closely with Form Tutors to maintain oversight of the day-to-day pastoral work with pupils from Years 7-11, whilst also overseeing the implementation of our PSHE programme. Our Head ofSixth Formmaintains pastoral oversight for Years 12 and 13, working closely with Sixth Form Form Tutors.",
  "The Deputy Head Pastoral is a member of our Senior Leadership Team and is our Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL). This means that any safeguarding concerns are reported straight to her. Should the Deputy Head Pastoral be absent or unavailable, then our Deputy DSL is our Associate Head and our Senior Teacher Pastoral and PSHE.",
  "Should any concerns arise, parents are invited to make contact with their daughter’s’ Form Tutor in the first instance, but are most welcome to contact the Senior Teacher Pastoral and PSHE or the Deputy Head Pastoral, should it be necessary.",

  "Safeguarding",
  "Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of the pupils at our School is our first priority. Our approach is child-centred and all actions are taken in the best interests of the child.",
  "Should you ever have a safeguarding concern, please email:mkeeley@morehousemail.org.uk",

  "There is a thorough assessment and tracking framework in place that monitors how well pupils are faring in their learning. (ISI Inspection Report 2024)",
  "What is evident is the real strength of partnerships – with parents, and the wider community and the way in which you engage with them to ensure pupils receive the best. (Diocesan Inspection Report 2019)",

  "Founded in 1952 by a group of parents seeking better Catholic education for girls in London, More House is a school that celebrates the talents of each unique child, and encourages young women to be agents of change.",
  "More House celebrated 50 years since moving into Pont Street.",
  "More House celebrated its Golden Jubilee.",
  "The school moved into its new home at the beginning of the summer term.",
  "The school was threatened with closure due to lack of funds. On Saturday 11th October, a group of pupils staged a protest march to Cardinal Heenan’s home in Westminster to save their school. The Cardinal pledged his support with a guarantee from the church, thus saving the school from closure.",
  "The school purchased new premises at 22 Pont Street.",
  "More House continued to flourish with a complement of 110 girls, when in 1968, the Canonesses decided reluctantly that they must give up the school in order to concentrate on the university chaplaincy, hostel, and Catholic centre. The current parents formed an Association in order to save the school and took it over under lay management.",
  "The first cohort of More House girls reached school-leaving age.",
  "Mother Veronica left More House to travel to Uganda where she took over a school for African girls, expanded it and raised it to university entry standard. After Mother Veronica’s departure, Mother St Dominic was appointed Headmistress.",
  "More House School now had over 90 pupils, had been inspected by the Ministry of Education and was officially recognised as an efficient Independent Secondary School.",
  "More House’s pupil roll had now grown and was recognised as an established school with two classes of girls. The Canonesses took St Thomas More as Patron Saint of the school, embodying Faith and Education.",
  "More House Schoolwas founded by a group of parents and opened by the canonesses of St Augustine to three pupils, in a hostel they ran for Catholic students on Cromwell Road in South Kensington. Mother Veronica Balfour, the founding Headmistress, was the first nun to gain a degree at Cambridge.",

  "Participation of each individual contributing to a greater collective aim is a strong element of the House system at More House. The events are designed to provide an opportunity for students to express themselves no matter what their interests. The events have different levels of competitive ethos so everyone can feel comfortable yet challenged. Daily, all students amass credits and debits which count towards their House total in addition to points for various events.",
  "A different House event is run almost weekly throughout the year. The calendar is varied each year to ensure it remains vibrant and appealing. The stalwart events that have been mainstays throughout the House system include Sports Day, House Talent Show, House Entertainment Production, Engineering Challenge, House Netball, Rounders’ Day, House Brains and Countdown and various subject-specific events. Each of these holds a special place in the heart of our students and the level of engagement from the participants and the audience is always fantastic.",
  "The organisation around House activities creates opportunities for pupils to take on responsibility. Taking responsibility enhances self-confidence and develops leadership skills. Opportunities include: planning events and/or assemblies; preparing notice boards, motivating others to participate and leading a team to achieve a common goal. Each House is run by a House Captain from the Upper Sixth. They meet weekly as part of a leadership programme that helps them to develop their confidence leading the House assembly and supports them in planning and running the House events.",
  "The House system provides opportunities for pupils to work together from different tutor groups and year groups. It provides opportunities for teamwork and opportunities to reflect how individuals contribute to a shared vision. Older students are paired with new students in the House when they first arrive to act as mentors to help ease the transition to secondary school and then to offer advice and guidance on all elements of school life.",

  "The mind of a nine year old is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled. The nurturing environment at More House is the embodiment of this phrase. Our teachers support each individual, working to inspire the girls and instil a life‑long love of learning, in preparation for their journey into Year 7.",
  "At More House, our Years 5 and 6 girls follow the National Curriculum of English, Maths, Science, History, Geography, PSHE, Computing (ICT), Art, PE, Music and Modern Foreign Languages. Religious Studies is taught in accordance with the diocese’s planning framework.",
  "The ‘Even More Creative’ programme has been designed to inspire the children, enabling teachers to build upon the foundations learned in the classroom. By taking advantage of what’s on our doorstep, the children are able to explore a plethora of museums, galleries and outdoor spaces to include the National History Museum, Science Museum, Hyde Park, South Bank, and the Victoria & Albert Museum.",
  "Smaller class sizes and passionate, dedicated teachers create the perfect environment where every child can truly flourish. With individualised attention, each child isn’t just another face in the crowd; they are seen, heard, and valued. This approach fosters a profound sense of belonging, allowing children to feel secure and empowered as they navigate their unique learning journeys. Personalised learning plans cater to their strengths and interests, sparking curiosity and enthusiasm, ensuring every child not only meets but exceeds their potential, setting them up for a lifetime of success and confidence.",
  "Our dedicated and compassionate pastoral team creates a nurturing and inclusive environment where every individual feels valued and supported. We offer a safe and welcoming space for emotional and social growth, encouraging self-expression and celebrating the unique qualities that make each person special. With a focus on personal development, we guide individuals through life’s challenges, providing them with the tools, empathy, and understanding they need to thrive. Our aim is to empower them to build resilience, confidence, and a sense of belonging, ensuring they have the support system necessary to navigate their personal journeys with strength and a positive approach.",

  "More House offers a bespoke education that is future-focussed and prepares young women to be the ethical leaders of tomorrow. Our academic philosophy is underpinned by trust and strong teacher-pupil relationships. We know our students well and support them in succeeding both in and out of the classroom. More House is a greenhouse, not a hothouse. We provide a nurturing environment for all our students to grow to new heights.",
  "Excellent subject knowledge",
  "We value methods of teaching that are rooted in cognitive science and educational research, and prioritise the teaching of core knowledge, which we believe is vital to academic success. We deliberately teach revision and study skills to ensure that core knowledge is secure in the long-term memory and repeat tests and assessments throughout the year to promote ‘over-learning’. We believe that, over time, this fosters confidence and academic pride, whilst providing a secure foundation for the performance of more nuanced skills.",
  "Stretch and challenge for all",
  "Our students are challenged to achieve new heights, whilst being given the personal academic support and guidance they need in order to excel. We believe that every student has a gift. We identify these gifts and provide a personal academic and co-curricular programme to enable every student to reach her full potential. In lessons, our students are challenged to think critically about the world around them and about their work, reflect on their own progress and to map a path of personal growth towards even greater achievement.",
  "You can find out more about our Be More programmehere.",
  "Responsible and innovative use of technology",
  "More House is an innovative learning space, where every student uses a personal device to enhance the classroom experience. Teachers are enthusiastic, energetic and creative and have been fully trained in the use of innovative technologies in the classroom and online safety. Lesson materials are shared, submitted and returned through Google Classroom and our students are provided training and support in the responsible use of technology. We have adopted a blended approach to learning that recognises the importance of digital skills, whilst ensuring that creativity, drawing, making, building, handwriting and group work continues to be developed.",
  "What I love about More House is that as a pupil you don’t feel pressured to do well, but rather you want to do well in everything you do because you’re made to feel that you have every capability of achieving what you want.",
  "More House is a greenhouse, not a hothouse. We provide a nurturing environment for all our students to grow to new heights.",
  "High quality and effective feedback",
  "Teachers at More House are highly qualified, talented, and committed. We teach responsively, which means that we are constantly engaged in the act of adapting our teaching based on our assessment of students learning in order to maximise their progress. We seek to make explicit what excellence looks like and communicate this clearly to our students. We provide feedback that enables our students to improve, constantly building on their previous skills and knowledge to meet new academic goals. At the same time, they are equipped with the scientific principles of cognitive psychology that underpin learning, and proficient in employing techniques for retaining and recalling knowledge, developing and refining skills, and assessing and evaluating the quality of their learning.",
  "High expectations of behaviour for learning",
  "Visitors to our school comment on the students enthusiasm for learning. They are keen to get the most out of lessons and motivated to achieve their best. Students recognise that learning requires them to inhabit the space between right and wrong, confidence and uncertainty, and to be comfortable there. Our students take their learning seriously, but also know how to have fun in the classroom. They are rewarded for their commitment to high standards of work and diligence and they strive to achieve this.",

  "We believe that Art and Design has a central role to play in preparing our pupils for a changing world. Our aim is to provide an Art and Design education of the highest quality, promoting social engagement and a broad view of the world.",
  "Pupils are guided in developing a sense of discovery through the making process. Critical thinking and personal reflection are central to pupils developing the skills required to produce meaningful, high-quality artwork.",
  "Lessons in observational skills, eye-to-hand coordination, manipulating materials, and colour theory help the girls develop their own style in Art and Design and express themselves. They learn to critically respond to other artworks and deepen their understanding of technique, genre, and the purpose of artistic expression. We devise lessons that allow each pupil’s creative processes to grow organically, supporting them as they flourish into accomplished artists.",
  "In Years 7 to 9 pupils will work with a wide variety of techniques including drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, textiles, fashion and costume. The starting point for each year is an understanding of the formal elements and principles of Art and Design. Pupils develop the ability to respond to the work of others during gallery and museum trips and are encouraged to express their own opinions and learn how to validate them. Pupils undertake cross-curricular projects, with a focus on creativity and innovation, to give the pupils an opportunity to work in teams to create, develop and market an idea that will be judged by an industry professional. Pupils are encouraged to attend extra-curricular activities including Art club, Textiles club and Photography club.",
  "The Art department had a very positive impact on me, increasing my confidence in my abilities and creativity.  I really enjoyed the teaching and being encouraged to try new techniques and mediums.Kana U6",
  "In Years 10 and 11 at GCSE level the pupils can focus on up to three areas of Art and Design, including Fine Art, Graphic Communication, Textile Design, Three-dimensional Design and Photography.",
  "An initial introduction to skills and techniques at the beginning of Year 10 gives the pupils a solid foundation upon which to explore their own ideas. There is scope built into the projects to allow for independent investigations. We believe drawing skills are the foundation of Art and Design practice and projects begin with formal and experimental drawing. This impresses upon the pupils the importance of refining their drawing skills. GCSE Art and Design provides a space where pupils can develop personal ideas and explore creative thinking. Pupils often comment on the freedom and independence of thought afforded them in this subject. Workshop style support sessions are also offered after school.",
  "At A level we offer both Textiles, and Art and Design. The courses begin with a review of skills and techniques in the Autumn term of Lower Sixth. Following this, each project begins with a block of observational drawing. They continue to explore creative solutions to their own ideas (with reference to historical and contemporary practitioners), experiment with a range of materials, and produce written work connected to their own chosen area of study.",
  "By this stage, they are confident in devising their own projects.They have a plethora of sources to draw inspiration from. Their cultural awareness becomes evident through the connections they make to the work of others. As they find their own visual language and voice, they specialise in the most appropriate materials to communicate their ideas.",
  "Weekly Life Drawing and Portfolio sessions are offered to students at A level to support them in preparing for interviews at Foundation or BA Honours level. We have an excellent success rate of students securing places to study on Fashion, Textiles, Architecture, Animation, Film and Fine Art courses UK wide.",
  "Since 2008 we have experienced a ‘once in a lifetime’ financial recession and a centennial pandemic. The impact of these supposedly rare events has spread to every corner of our planet and no one in the UK has been left unmarked whether they are aged 2 or 92.",
  "We already faced a climate crisis that threatens our planet, a realignment of our political and economic ties with our near neighbours and the decline of our local high streets. Will London become a donut city? Are these big external events happening more frequently? Are they all intertwined? Can our response to one problem help us solve the others? Never has there been a time when such an alignment of momentous events demanded our attention and understanding.",
  "I can’t thank you enough for all the business skills that you taught me over the years that helped me secure my jobPast pupil",
  "As citizens, consumers, employees and entrepreneurs we will all be involved with the world of business and the economic and political models that underpin the decision making that will determine our individual wealth and happiness as well as that of our towns, cities and planet. The department is particularly keen to widen the perspective away from traditional models of the economy by introducing and promoting the work of recognised female economists such as Kate Rowe and Mariana Mazzucato as well as Rebecca Henderson (Professor of Management and Strategy, Harvard Business School). We strongly believe that women bring fresh thinking into fields long dominated by white, western men.",
  "At More House we are lucky to have a wealth of business activities to explore on our doorstep, from customer service at Peter Jones to workshops on inflation and monetary policy at the Bank of England, as well as theatre trips such as ‘Money the Game Show’ and ‘Kinky Boots’. Parents and old girls are an important resource and our location makes it easy to arrange visits and speakers.",
  "Business and Economics B are taught at A Level and the department currently follows the Edexcel syllabus for both. For each the content is slightly less theoretical and mathematical than other boards. Over the two year course students consider aspects of marketing, human resources, finance and operations management from a local to a global perspective. Girls wanting to study pure Economics follow AQA who have introduced new models including Behavioral Economics.",

Ultimately we want to educate the hearts, minds and spirits of pupils and ensure that their lives are illumined in faith.  All pupils at More House will study RS through to GCSE level.",
  "In Years 7 – 9 pupils follow the framework from a series called, “The Way, The Truth, and The Life.” This programme is based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the Religious Education Curriculum Directory for Catholic Schools published by the Bishops’ Conference.",
  "During Years 10 – 11 pupils are prepared for their RS GCSE which is a rigorous course of study, allowing the pupils to develop their knowledge of world religions, critical thinking and evaluation skills and self-understanding.  The exams at the end of Year 11 are in Roman Catholic Christianity and Judaism.",
  "It is one of my favourite subjects because of the range of content covered, the wealth of philosophical concepts and the level of critical thought required to evaluate",
  "The A level syllabus in Religious Studies provides a broad, coherent and worthwhile course of study. Pupils study three components: Theology (Introduction to Christianity), Philosophy of Religion, and Religious Ethics.",
  "A-level religious studies encourages learners to develop their interest in a rigorous study of religion and belief and relate it to the wider world. Pupils are encouraged to develop an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion, including considering the views of scholars/academics, the ability to analyse the nature of connections between the components they have studied, their own values, opinions and attitudes, in the light of their study.",
  "Every pupil in the sixth form is required to attend weekly core religious studies. Pupils examine a wide range of philosophical, theological, ethical and moral issues, from euthanasia to medical ethics, faith and science to human dignity and human trafficking.",
  "Pupils are able to critically reflect on and understand the meaning and importance of a range of sacred texts and sources of wisdom. Pupils demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the complexity of religious teachings and beliefs and personal choices and commitments. Pupils also critically evaluate religious and non-religious views and are well versed in independent and well-argued accounts of their own and others’ views.",
  "Science at More House inspires students to ask questions about the world around them. Our department is passionate about harnessing students’ natural curiosity to develop the deep understanding of Science and Technology that will be vital in their futures. We encourage our students to be creative in the application of their scientific thinking and offer opportunities for independent research for all students from Year 7 to Sixth form. Small class sizes enable us to tailor lessons to students, encouraging their passions and interests and ensuring that every student is supported to fulfil their ambitions.",
  "All students at More House School study all three Sciences (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) from Years 7 to 11 when they sit their GCSE exams. After GCSE, many of them progress with one or more of the sciences to attain good grades at AS or A-level with the support and guidance of experienced specialist teachers.",
  "To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science.",
  "Our students are excited by science from the start of their journey with us in Year 7 through to Upper Sixth and beyond. Our A-level scientists are proud ambassadors for their subjects, often strengthen their own love of the subjects through sharing knowledge or supporting junior students through clubs while pursuing an interest with their own holiday projects.",
  "In Years 7 and 8 our young scientists explore phenomena that they will have noticed in their everyday lives. How do we use and digest our food? Why is it hard to balance on a beam? How small is the smallest thing? We use scientific methodology and models to investigate these mysteries with experiments in laboratories with scientific equipment. More House School has a proud history of success in the Big Bang Fairs, both regionally and nationally. Students have the option of attending Science Fair Club where they choose an area of study and prepare for the regional Big Bang Science Fairs.",
  "Students start preparing for their GCSE exams in Year 9 with an engaging curriculum that aims to bring the abstract theories of science into context. Cross-curricular links are made with Art, Mathematics, Geography, Classics, Robotics and Music to show how the fundamentals of science are core to all areas of our lives. Students have the choice of taking the Combined Science course or three separate sciences at GCSE.",
  "More House School offers A-levels in Biology, Psychology, Chemistry and Physics. These are all taught in small university tutorial style classes. Students use the schools’ extensive experimental equipment to support their A level courses and add breadth and colour to take their knowledge gained beyond curriculum the courses.",
  "Students are encouraged to work independently and read widely to foster their study skills and prepare them for their future and a love of lifelong learning. We run regular trips for students, taking full advantage of the nearby Scientific Institutes, museums, parks and Universities.",

  "In the Sixth Form, we build a program of study to suit each individual learner. The small size of our cohort means that teachers and students have strong bonds and we are able to meet the needs of each student, and adapt our offering regularly to reflect the interests of our current Sixth Formers. We balance pastoral care, academic excellence, life skill development, co-curricular clubs and activities, leadership opportunities, career planning, Super Curriculum learning and wellbeing with individualised care and attention. No student blends in with the crowd in the Sixth Form at More House, each student is known, catered for and challenged by our dedicated and passionate Sixth Form staff. The result of this personalised care and attention means that our students achieve their goals, with 50% of our 2020-21 cohort achieving grades A*-A in their A Level courses and 82% achieving A*-B.",
  "Through our expert pastoral care, we emphasise the importance of self-awareness and open discussion when it comes to making important decisions during sixth form such as work experience placements and further education. The results of this individualised care can be found in our exceptionally high (95%) rate of pupils moving on to their first choice university or apprenticeship. Our most recent results and university destinations can be foundhere.",
  "Students in the Sixth Form have access to theMore House Super Curriculum website, a hub for all the learning they can do beyond their A-Level specifications. Super Curriculum activities are those that take the regular curriculum studies further. They take the subject studied in the classroom beyond that which teachers have taught or set for homework. On this site, there are a range of activities for students to stretch themselves and explore their subjects in their Super Curriculum period, timetabled one lesson per week. During this hour students should spend:",
  "30 minutes engaging with material",
  "15 minutes reflecting on the material",
  "15 minutes sharing their new knowledge",
  "Students also have 30 mins per week dedicated to tracking and monitoring their Super Curriculum progress with their form tutor including sharing and promoting resources to one another. Super Curriculum activities are split into the following categories: Watch, Listen, Create, Research, Read, Write.",
  "As every learner is unique, we offer a bespoke program for each student, rather than a ‘one size fits all’ admissions policy. We work with each family to ensure that students find the right balance of subjects to push them to achieve their potential and expand their reach for life beyond school. Whilst doing this we also work to nourish the confidence of each student, and provide personalised support embedded into her timetable to ensure she can achieve her learning goals.",

  "Our new Creative Suite, sporting five wall mounted energy efficient screens, adaptable work stations where students often stand instead of sitting, access to robotics, an abundance of Lego and four Cricut machines, is providing opportunities for all departments to explore, discover and create.",
  "At More House, this new space marks a step towards the development of a curriculum that acknowledges that the confines of the standard classroom do not serve every child. As educators, we must work hard to provide opportunities for every child to engage creatively and critically with their learning.",
  "This adaptable space is not only geared towards the teaching of Digital Skills, but opens up all sorts of possibilities for different departments to do things differently, from weather reports and model making in Geography, to set and lighting design with Lego in Drama and automated solutions in Business Studies.",
  "We envisage the More House Creative Suite as a place of wonder – without limits, but filled to the brim with possibility, critical exploration and courageous innovation. Even historically important buildings like ours can offer a taste of the future!",

  "We pride ourselves on knowing our students as individuals, our Be More programme is designed with that in mind. We identify students who have the potential to excel both inside and outside of the classroom, to ensure they are motivated and inspired, building their confidence and resilience so that they can achieve new heights.",
  "There are two strands to our programme, academic and co-curricular. As part of the academic programme, departments have designed challenging and inspiring curriculums, encouraging debate, perseverance and academic excellence. Our co-curricular programme ensures students can increase the breadth and depth of their knowledge and understanding through a vast array of clubs and activities as diverse as Introduction to Italian Club led by students, and STEM Club. We have a range of guest speakers across the year who specialise in industries such as Medicine, Law, Politics and Engineering. Students participate in regular trips to universities and cultural institutions to inspire them and encourage a sense of purpose.",
  "It was an intimidating experience, but definitely worth it. I faced my fears of speaking in public. I left feeling accomplished, brave, and powerful!",
  "Our Be More programme is inclusive, with students invited to join the programme on recommendation from staff or peers at any point in their More House journey. These students are offered mentoring and advice on both strands of our programme. Most of the clubs and activities are open to all students, to ensure that everyone at More House benefits from the opportunities available.",
  "At Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 our more able students are offered academic mentoring from the Sixth Form and staff, where they can discuss their academic progress, how they are participating in school life, wider reading and a tailored programme of clubs and activities are recommended to them.",
  "In our Sixth Form, staff work with our more able students to tailor our academic programme and ensure students are extending themselves within and outside of the classroom. Speakers and journal clubs are hosted by departments, trips and workshops run regularly and students are guided to attend the fantastic events hosted by London universities and learned societies.",
  "Events such as the Be More Brunch are held regularly and focus on fostering vital skills such as critical thinking and reasoning, whilst developing confidence and a sense of community. More Talks is a new initiative where students will research, develop and present TEDx style talks on a variety of topics. The initiative allows students to practise the art of storytelling whilst delivering talks about their passions.",
  "Applicants to Oxbridge and other leading universities are given guidance and assistance as they make their choices and complete their applications, and any who are invited to interview will be given mock interviews both internally and with contacts outside school.",

  "At More House School, we cherish the whole person and are not bound by traditional measures of success. Our pupils know that they are so much more than the grades they achieve as students.",
  "In order to reach their potential, their happiness and self-confidence as learners is paramount, so we adopt a whole school approach to learning support. Our teachers are aware of the different needs of pupils and able to differentiate lessons more effectively due to small class sizes. We focus on the individual and offer a bespoke education to all. We pay equal attention to cognitive and emotional factors and offer anintegratedapproach. The goal of all support isto include and enableeach pupil to achieve their very best and to become asindependentas possible.",
  "We are also able to draw upon the services of a range of external practitioners, where required. This may include, for example, educational psychologists, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, art therapists, music therapists and psychotherapists.",
  "Support is provided in a variety of formats depending on the unique needs of each pupil. The intensity and duration of support is based on the pupil’s specific needs.  Support can include one-to-one or group sessions focusing on, for example:",

  "organisational skills",

  "Support is reviewed regularly and always in liaison with subject teachers to ensure that the needs of pupils are met. SEND staff also observe lessons throughout the year providing supportive feedback to staff on aspects of their practice. This also provides a key means of assessing how pupils are managing in class, enabling us to develop a more nuanced and rounded understanding.  Support is always viewed as a collaborative endeavour between SEND staff, pupils, teachers and home.",
  "SEND staff are qualified to conduct assessments for examination access arrangements. We have access to a range of psychometric tests, which can be used for more detailed assessments. We can also arrange external assessments where needed. We can support pupils regardless of whether a formal diagnosis of a special educational need or disability is present.",

  "At More House, we celebrate academic achievement, but know that this is not what defines our pupils. We value the whole person and our girls achieve so much more in their time with us than a set of grades. These results represent success in so many ways, as each learner’s journey is unique.",
  "As you know crude statistics do not do justice to the value-added scores and individual successes and achievements of every one of our girls. Our value-added results continue to underline how, relative to their academic starting points, More House girls outperform other schools with similar intakes in public examinations. In terms of Value Added, we can confidently say that we have added at least one grade to pupils’ outcomes, on average, across all subjects.",

  "Being in central London, More House is perfectly positioned to use all that the city has to offer as an extension of our school buildings. Our science labs are the London parks, the world-class museums are our exhibition halls and London’s modes of public transport are our school corridors.",
  "We make the best of all that London has to offer and we claim these special places as our own, providing as many opportunities as possible for our pupils to enjoy them, learn from them and think bigger than the four walls of their classrooms.",
  "In Key Stage 3, pupils are taken off timetable once a half-term for a City Curriculum Day. These days are cross-curricular in nature and give our students the chance to explore what they are learning in lessons and to bring the outside world into their understanding of all they are discovering in school.",
  "Where a small school meets the big city",
  "More House ensures that the girls leave them with whatever they need to head to their next stage of life. They offer flexibility and creative solutions to allow for the individual needs of pupils.",
